# Module 6 challenge 

## Description

My motivation whilst creating this repository was to make an application that allows me to schedule trips or make plans by knowing the weather/forecast for my destination city. I accomplished this by utilizing jquery and dayjs aswell as openweather api database to get current weather adn forecast. I display the up to date weather and forecast when called as well as saving recent searches to easily check back at your last search.
